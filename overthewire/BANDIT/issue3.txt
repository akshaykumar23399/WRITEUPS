BANDIT OVERTHEWIRE.org issue3

right now we are logged in as bandit2, and next task is to gain password from the file "spaces in this filename"
in this we cant simply "cat" out the file as it takes spaces sperated words as different file names hence,

# cat spaces in this file namea
{this wont work clearly}

Now, to do this as mostly we use the bash and ssh terminal for interpreting and run scripts, this interpreter contain a simple escape element 
which tends to make the next character to it invisible to the interpreter or processor.
escaping or skip element : "\"
any character next to "\" is not carried out by the compiler, application of this here is we use it as to skip spaces " " between the file 
name like:

$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

or simply write "cat" and spaces and press tab for autocompletion.

username --> bandit3
password --> UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
