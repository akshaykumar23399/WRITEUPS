given problem statement ::
 
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration 
and see what command is being executed.

"cron" is a job scheduling thing which makes some script execute every once in a while, lets change directory to the given directory..

$ cd /etc/crom.d/
/etc/cron.d/$ ls
cronjob_bandit22  cronjob_bandit23  cronjob_bandit24

we want pass for the bandit22 so just cat out the cronjob..

/etc/cron.d$ cat cronjob_bandit22
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null

these "*" means that all the time combinations are accepted and the job is done every time.
lets see the script/document that is being executed.

change directory to the ".sh" file.

$ cd /usr/bin
/usr/bin$ cat cronjob_bandit22.sh
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

this is bash script that chmod's the file "/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv", 644 in the param means that files are readable and 
writeable by the owner of the file and readable by users in the group owner of that file and readable by everyone else.

and the output of the file /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 is injected in the file /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv sooooo se simply cat out
the path to the file i.e: "/tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv"

$ cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
