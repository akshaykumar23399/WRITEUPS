ISSUE7 BANDIT OVERTHEWIRE-org

as we are currently in bandit6 account and given for next password is :: 

The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:

owned by user bandit7
owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size

lets, first analyze the given part >

1. the file user is "bandit7" means, the user is the acccount holder whose password we have to find.
2. the file group is "bandit6" means, file is grouped containing bandit6 as the member of the group.
3. file size is 33, pretty much self explanatory

now, first lets list the contents of the account bandit6  

$ ls
$

there isnt any showable directory in this account, and question states "somewhere on the server" so,
lets do find and see what so we have,

$ find
.
./.bash_logout
./.profile
./.bashrc

these files are not real directories, although they contains data but passsword isnt there surely, {server files mainly}

to learn about "find" command more lets man it and see what we have,
 
$ man find

the required details we want to know are : -user, -group, -size. as their name suggests they can be initialised as user, group, and size of
the files we need.

syntax : lets find a file from whole server(not only the account) whose size is 33 bytes and user is bandit7 and group is bandit6

we get these files and almost all are out of our scope or isnt a directory, on a closer look file /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password is 
accessible to us hence,
 
$ file /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password: ASCII text

hence its a readable file and password must be there.

$ cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs

hence we got our password yay!

username --> bandit7
password --> HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs
