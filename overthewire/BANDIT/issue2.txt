OVERTHEWIRE.org {BANDIT}

currently we are in bandit0 login now when we have our bandit1 login creds, we can login in the bandit1 account....

# ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
then enter the password to login.

username --> bandit1
password --> boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1

OK, now for new password we have a file named "-"
this time simply "cat" file wont work as it reads it as some additionnal param is being fed with "cat" command

$ cat -
{wont work clearly}
$ cat <full file path to password containing thing>
$ cat /home/bandit1/-
