problem statement ::

There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only 
line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new
NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19

it is a rather simple question,
just use "diff" command to differentiate between files line by line.

$ diff passwords.old passwords.new
42c42
