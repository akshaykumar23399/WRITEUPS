BANDIT OVERTHEWIRE.org issue4

next task is to find password in directory "inhere/" in bandit3 account

# ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
# UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK

$ ls
inhere
$ cd inhere
~/inhere$ ls
~/inhere$  

ls command in inhere directory dont reveal anything literally, but maybe the content is hidden then list the hidden file like:

~/inhere$ ls -a
. .. .hidden
~/inhere$ cat .hidden

file was indeed hidden, only needed the name of the file and here we are with "catting" the file and obtaining the password.

username --> bandit4
password --> pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB
