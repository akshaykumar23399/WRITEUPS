create a bash script containing a for loop which is iterating all the combinations and 
giving output as 

"UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ" $i 

here, $i goes from 0000 to 9999

do save the output in the file like :: 

echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ" $i > pass.txt

then cat the file with piping it with netcat on 30002

cat pass.txt | nc localhost 30002
