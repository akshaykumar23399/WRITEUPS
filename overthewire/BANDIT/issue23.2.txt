ISSUE23 V.2.0 BANDIT OVERTHEWIRE.org

ok so issue 23 was wrong as, if u tried u'll know soo.....

when we saw the script all we have to do was that change the var. :: whoami to bandit23,
and the script was wants higher priv. to edit the scripts so we cant edit the oirginal 
script and cant use a new one bcz of bandit23_pass cant be accesed by the babndit22 user

what we do is "string formatting" like just change the $whoami in the assigning part to
bandit23 and we'll get the hash which can be printed with cat in the tmp folder.

/usr/bin$ mytarget=$(echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
/usr/bin$ echo $mytarget 
8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349
usr/bin$ cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349

password --> jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n
