given problem :: 

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a 
commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If 
the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

so we have to connect to some port and we also have to pass the password, also the binary only accepts one argument i.e: port number.
binary reads the text from the "connection" means TCP/UDP.

we need 2 terminal to logged in bandit20 in which one of em runs the binary and one of em sends the passwords to the binary and to set 
listner on the specified port, using netcat "nc" to setup a listner and passing the password so.

$ nc -lvp 7777 
listening on [any] 7777 ...

connect to [127.0.0.1] from localhost [127.0.0.1] 47890

while this happens in other terminal run the program,
as,
$ ./suconnect 7777
