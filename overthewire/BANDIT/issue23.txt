A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration 
and see what command is being executed.
NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. 
If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.

so lets head to the script..

$ cat /usr/etc/cronjob_bandit23.sh
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget

this script simply takes "bandit22" and md5sums a strings and saves the crypto as a file name and saves the file in that.

to bypass simply execute the script.

$ sh /usr/etc/cronjob_bandit23.sh
Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 to /tmp/8169b67bd894ddbb4412f91573b38db3

cat it out 

$ cat /tmp/8169b67bd894ddbb4412f91573b38db3
